# new_houseplant_game
##Personal Project from NuCamp Python Fundamentals
###The goal of this game is to keep a new houseplant alive after 30 days. The user can choose between different houseplants allowing the user to select between different care tasks to perform every 3 days. Each plant has specific needs programmed into the game where the user must keep in mind as they choose the care tasks every 3 days. By the end of the 30 day period, an algorithm generates a score that determines whether or not the plant lived or died. The user then has the option to review the scores, add a plant to the library, or play again/terminate the program.
####This is a terminal based text game to be executed in the new_houseplant_game folder: python new_housplant_main.py
